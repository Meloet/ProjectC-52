            <li>
                Cicadas don't live very long, or at least compared to how long they live underground as opposed to aboveground!
            </li>
            <li>
                Cicadas love to sing, they will chirp to communicate, to find mates, and just for fun!
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                Pigeons are very common birds in some places, but rare in others!
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeons are a split case, some people think their really dumb, and others think its just an act.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeon apperantly tastes really good, but I've never personally tried it.

                Camels can store water in their humps so they can go a long time without drinking water!

                Camels, in ancient times and even now are basically required to cross the Sahara Desert in Africa!
