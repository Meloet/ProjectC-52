                Cicadas don't live very long, or at least compared to how long they live underground as opposed to aboveground!
            </li>
            <li>
                Cicadas love to sing, they will chirp to communicate, to find mates, and just for fun!
            </li>
            <li>
                Cicadas are one of many bugs with wings

        <ul>
            <li>
                Pigeons are very common birds in some places, but rare in others!
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeons are a split case, some people think their really dumb, and others think its just an act.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pigeon apperantly tastes really good, but I've never personally tried it.
